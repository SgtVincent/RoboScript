Our task is to put the drink can into the bowl. This picture shows the scene after the robot completes its action. Please analyze this scenario first and then directly answer whether the task was successful. Please output relevant information in python dictionary format. 

# Example 1:
{
    'task':'put the apple in the cabinet'
    "objects": [
            "<apple>",
            "<cabinet>"
        ],
    "your_explanation": "This task is to put the apple in the cabinet. From the picture, you can see that the apple is on the table, not in the cabinet, so the task failed."

    "current_spatial_relations": 
        {
            "<apple>": "on(<table>)"
        }
    "mission success": "No"
}

# Example 2:
{
    'task':'put the chips in the bowl'
    "objects": [
            "<chips>",
            "<bowl>"
        ],
    "your_explanation": "This task is to put the chips in the bowl. From the picture, you can see that the chips is on the bowl, so the task succeed."

    "current_spatial_relations": 
        {
            "<chips>": "on(<bowl>)"
        }
    "mission success": "Yes"
}

The "objects" field denotes the list of objects. Enclose the object names with '<' and '>'. Connect the words without spaces, using underscores instead. Do not include human beings in the object list.
The "current_spatial_relations" field denotes the list of relationships between objects. Use only the following functions to describe these relations: [inside(), on()]. For example, 'on(<office_table>)' indicates that the object is placed on the office table. We believe that in and on are the same positional relationship and do not make any specific distinction. Ignore any spatial relationships between objects that are not relevant to the task.

# Please take note of the following.
1. Focus only on the objects related to the task and omit object that are not being mentioned in this task. Explain what you included and what you omitted and why in the "your_explanation" field. 
2. The response should be a Python dictionary only, without any explanatory text (e.g., Do not include a sentence like "here is the environment").
3. Insert "python" at the beginning and then insert "" at the end of your response.
